Must be lowercase and less than or equal to 63 characters in length. A full list of bucket naming rules may be found here. The name must not be in the format [bucket_name]--[azid]--x-s3. Use the aws_s3_directory_bucket resource to manage S3 Express buckets.

These objects are not recoverable. This only deletes objects when the bucket is destroyed, not when setting this parameter to true. Once this parameter is set to true, there must be a successful terraform apply run before a destroy is required to update this value in the resource state. Without a successful terraform apply after this parameter is set, this flag will have no effect. If setting this field in the same operation that would require replacing the bucket or destroying the bucket, this flag will not work. Additionally when importing a bucket, a successful terraform apply is required to set this value in state before it will take effect on a destroy operation.
